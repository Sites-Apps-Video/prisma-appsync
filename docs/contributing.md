2. InstallÂ [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) (for installing dependencies)
3. InstallÂ [yarn@1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (for building the project before deploy)
4. Install [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) (for running project scripts)
5. InstallÂ [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)Â (for bundling the project before deploy and local server)
6. Install theÂ [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) (for deploying on AWS)
7. Install theÂ [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) (for deploying on AWS)

**Verify installation:**

```bash

```

### Dev Setup

```graphql
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/maoosi/prisma-appsync.git

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run local dev playground
pnpm dev
```

### Helpful commands

| Command | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `pnpm install` | Install project dependencies. |
| `pnpm test` | Run all unit tests and e2e tests. |
| `pnpm build` | Build the entire prisma-appsync library. |
| `pnpm dev` | Creates local dev setup, useful for contributing [1]. |

> [1] Automatically generates a playground folder (unless already existing), plus run a local GraphQL + AWS AppSync server pointing to the playground folder. This creates an ideal local dev environment that emulates Prisma-AppSync running on AWS locally. Everything inside playground is pointing local source packages.
